# HTML, CSS & JavaScript

## HTML

The **Definition List** is created with the `<dl>` element and usually consists of a series of terms inside `<dt>` element and their definitions inside `<dd>` element.

## CSS 

By default a **box** is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the **height** and
**width** properties.Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance, which are:

1. **Border**: That separates the edge of one box from another.
2. **Margin**: To create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes, by setting the width of a margin.
3. **Padding**: Is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.It's used to increase the readability of its contents, by adding padding.

## JavaScript

### ARRAYS

**Array**: Is a list of related items, and it's a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

**Array literal**: The preferred method for creating an array, That is by writing the whole values inside a square brackets.

**Index**: Is a number given automatically to each item in an array, and start from zero not one, and it's used to access specific items in the array.
Here is an example for creating an array and change values inside it:

1. Create an array in array literal method: `var colors = ['white', 'black', 'gray'];`
2. Access and change second value in the array: `colors[1] = 'orange' ;`

**Switch** statement starts with a variable called the **switch value**. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. It's providing better *performance* than multiple if statements.

**Type coercion**: To complete an operation, JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes.
