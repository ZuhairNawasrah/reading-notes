# HTML and CSS Languages

## HTML

**HTML** is a Hypertext markup language, and to use it we write the code with something called *Tages*. There is two types of tages:
1. Opening and closing tages, which need a closing part to make it valid, and the major of tages are this type, e.g:
`<p> </p>` , `<ls></ls>`
2. Self-closing tages, which are just one part, e.g:
`<img/>`

Some of HTML tages need attributes, which provide additional information about the contents of an element, where the attributes place *inside the opening tage* just, e.g:
`<img scr="URL" alt="describe of the URL"/>`

For each HTML website, we need to organize the page, which make it as much as easy we can for the visitors, and we make that by using standard skeleton for the HTML website, as e.g, we insert the other pages on the header of home page as a navigation bar at first, also thats help the other developers who wanna make changes on the code, and that's so easy when the code is organized by some tages, where the developer know where should he edit the tage, e.g on these tages:
`<head></head>` , `<body></body>` , `<main></main>` , `<nav></nav>` .....etc.

Which the above tages don't affect the result, but makes you as a professional web developer, and as I said help others to edit your code *easily*.

## CSS

**CSS** is refer to cascading style sheets, which is a language that make a style for your website. To do that, we simply insert CSS code inside opening tages of HTML like an attribues, e.g:
`<p style="key:value"></p>`
