# Design Web with CSS

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. **RGB values**: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up, e.g:
* `rgb(100,100,90)`
2. **HEX codes**: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign, e.g: 
* `#ffedc8`
3. **Color names**:There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers, e.g: 
* `lightBlue`

There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML:
1. **Inline** that styles are plonked straight into the HTML tags using the style attribute, e.g:
* `<p> style="color: red">text</p>`
2. **Internal** that styles are used for the whole page. Inside the head element, the style tags surround all of the styles for the page, e.g:
* `<style> p {color: red;} </style>`
3. **External** that styles are used for the whole, multiple-page website. There is a **separate CSS file**, e.g:
* `p {color: red;}`
