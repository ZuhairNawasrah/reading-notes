# Loops

Loop statement check a condition, whenever the result of that condition is **True**, loop will execute the code inside it until the condition give a **False** result. There are three types of loops:
1. **For** loop: It's the most common one, it be used to run code a specific number of times, which mean the condition here is work as a counter.
2. **While** loop: It be used to run a code for unknown number of times.
3. **Do While** loop: It's similar to while, but the only difference is at first time of execute this statement, the code block inside it will run regardless the condition result.
 
E.g of code:
`for(var i=1; i < 10 ; i++)`
`{code.block}`

As you see in the e.g shown above, the for statement includes three parts in the condition section:
1. Initialization: to create a variable and set it to 0, which is commonly called i.
2. Condition: this part allow to loop to continue for executing or stop it.
3. Update: here is the value of i increase by one every time the loop execute the code-blook.
