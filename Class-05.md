# HTML & CSS Images, Color & Text

## HTML Images 

There are three rules to remember when you are creating images, which are:

1. Save images in the right format, where websites mainly use images in jpg, gif, or png format.
2. Save images at the right size, where you should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.
3. Use the correct resolution. Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file. Saving images at a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.

## CSS 

### Color

Regarding to using color correctly, the most important thing is to keep text legible whatever your color is. That is controlled by something called **Contrast**. So when picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text, why!! -as mentioned before- to keep text legible.

There are three classifications for Contrast:

1. **Low Contrast**: In this case, text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
2. **Medium Contrast**: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
3. **High Contrast**: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.

### Text

There are many properties that affect the text, one of these is called **Typeface**, and it has three types:

1. **Serif**: This is the easiest type for reading. Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as *serifs*.
2. **Sans-Serif**: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design. In case if the text is small,
sans-serif fonts can be clearer.
to read.
3. **Monospace**: This type is commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow. Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

**Attribute Selectors**: Selectors that allow you to create rules that apply to elements that have an attribute with a specific value. There are many types of it, here are some of it: 

1. **Existence**: Matches a specific attribute, whatever its value.
2. **Equality**: Matches a specific attribute with a specific value.
3. **Prefix**: Matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string.
