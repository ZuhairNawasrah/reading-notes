# Introduction to HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML

There are some new tags are used to describe the structure of the page, here is some of them:

1. `<b>` tag used to make characters appear bold, as well as `<strong>` tag make the same effect to text, even if it doesn't have the same meaning.
2. `<i>` tag used to make characters appear italic, as well as `<em>` tag make the same effect to text, even if it doesn't have the same meaning.
3. `<sup>` tag is used to contain characters that should be superscript. It is commonly used with math equations and expressions.
4. `<sub>` tag is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
5. `<br />` line break tag is used if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a same paragraph.
6. `<hr />` tag is used to create a break between themes, such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play, you can add a horizontal rule between sections using it. 



**Note**: When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as **white space collapsing**.

## CSS

**CSS Selectors**: There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. Here is the most commonly used selector types:

1. **Universal Selector**: That applies rules to all elements in the document, using the **asterisk** `*` symbol.
2. **Element Selector**: That applies rules to all elements from same type in the document.
3. **ID Selector**: Matches an element whose id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the **hash** `#` symbol.
4. **Class Selector**: Matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the **period** `.` symbol.

## JavaScript

To define any variable in JavaScript, there are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, lastName for their last name, and age for their age.
6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, *__firstName__* rather than *__firstname__* (this is referred to as **Camel Case**). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
