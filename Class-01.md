# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML

There are new HTML elements that will help us to use HTML effectively, which are:

1. `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

2. `<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>` element. 

3. `<iframe>` is like a little window that has been cut into your page, and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

4. `<meta>` element lives inside the `<head>` element and contains information about that web page.

### Escape Characters

An HTML escape character "entity" is used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©, invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces), and in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard. It's a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).  

**Tip**: HTML5 allows web page authors to place an `<a>` element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
In order to make building a website easier, we create a **Site Map** which is making a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

## Java-Script

Computers solve tasks in different ways than humans, so we need to learn to "think" like them.
In order to learn any new programming language, we need to get to grips with:
1. **Vocabulary**: The words that computers understand.
2. **Syntax**: How we put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.
3. **Debugging**: is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors "**bugs**" in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.
