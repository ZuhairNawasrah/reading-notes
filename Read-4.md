# JavaScript Introduction

## Script

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:
* Vocabulary: The words that computers understand.
* Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow.

## Expressions

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two types of expressions:
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE, e.g:
   `var color = 'beige';` The value of color is now beige, while beige here is a **undefined** value. Technically, **undefined** is a data type like a **number**, **string**, or **Boolean**.
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE, e.g:
   `var area = 3 * 2;` The value of area is now 6.

## Operators 

Expressions rely on things called **Operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. There are five types of operators:
1. **ASSIGNMENT** OPERATORS: assign a value to a variable, e.g:
   `color = 'beige';`
2. **ARITHMETIC** OPERATORS Perform basic math, eg:
   `area = 3 * 2;`
3. **STRING** OPERATORS: combine two strings, e.g:
   `greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';`
4. **COMPARISON** OPERATORS: compare two values and return true or false, e.g:
   `buy = 3 > 5;`
5. **LOGICAL** OPERATORS: combine expressions and return true or false, e.g:
   `buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`
